=Checking

-* lemmer needs to report only no-match or ambig

-* memory management needs to be correct before moving forward

* multi-stage validation for error-checking: 
  +form, +core, +sense and +periph
  	  -core = no recordable match
  	  +form means form is known
	  +core means core is OK, with or without form
	  +periph means all fields are OK

	  errors:
		-form = new form or typo for CORE
		-sense = unknown sense for CORE
		-periph = unknown XXX for CORE

=PSU etc.

-* .ang format needs review for sigs-conformity

-* additional annotation to be callable from lemmer

-* PSU needs to build compound fields like form/norm


=Integration I

-* cdl.c needs to generate unlemmed XCL

* xpd.c needs to load sigset-lists from config.xml

-* file/line needs passing to l-nodes

* '+' needs passing to l-nodes

* #lemmatizer: use sparse needs fixing and reimplementing

* EZ-PSU


=Lemmatizing

* new sig-lemming routine needed in libsigs

* bigram format needs review for sig-conformity


=Integration II

* lemmatizing needs integrating with atf2xtf


====

EZ-PSU implementation:

       #psu: allowed anywhere in ATF

       #psu: %nb ... => %akk-x-neobab ...

       xpdmanager harvests from ATF and updates 00lib/project.psu; updates
          01bld/*/glossary.psu
