L2 Code Organization
====================

The L2 library consists of a collection of
sublibraries:

  l2/form : parsing, storing and finding the core
  	    part of ilem and sigs, i.e., the string
	    representation of the signature proper
  l2/ilem : interlinear lemmatization handling
  l2/sigs : signature handling; the load framework
  	    for data used by the lemmatizer
  l2/tags : language tag handling
  l2/word : the wordset matching library
  l2/xcl2 : new XCL handling routines; the XCL data
  	    structure is very similar to v.1 but 
	    some of the administrative framework that
	    used to belong to the form structure lives
	    here now
