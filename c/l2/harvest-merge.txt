Harvest:

if lem_autolem:

   forms are checked for required components in sig_warn

in ilem_wrapup:

   sigs should be attached when there are no finds and the + flag
   	is set; + means not only 'don't warn' but also 'is approved'
   use attr 'newsig' not 'sig' for ease of harvesting

To perform a harvest:

   rip newsigs -- this means only approved sigs can possibly make it
       into the glossary
   create lang.new

To merge:

   if !lang.glo mv lang.new new.glo
   else g2manager.plx -merge lang

ISSUES:

	HOW TO HANDLE LEMMATA FROM NON-PROJ GLOSSARIES? F2_FLAG?
	need to know which they are for harvesting purposes, otherwise
	harvest doesn't ingest material from system sig files
	track origin-project separately from sig?


	PSU harvesting
