Don't create hybrid verbal forms.  

I.e., faced by variants u3-mu-e-ni-sig10 and u3-mu-ni-in-sig10, choose
one for the main text, but do *not* choose the combination
u3-mu-e-ni-in-sig10.

Avoid exaggerating variation.

I.e., if a verbal form u3-mu-e-ni-sig10 is statistically preferable in
one passage, and a form u3-mu-ni-in-sig10 seems preferable in another
otherwise identical passage, consider over-riding the statistics in
one or the other passage so that they use the same form, *as long as
both forms are evidenced by the data*.
