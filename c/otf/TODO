lib/chr
=======
	* state / langtok needs separating into different
	  modules
	* charsets should depend only on a lang setting, not
	  on the entire state mechanism

lib/atf
=======
	* all the lem-running in text.c has to be factored
	  out to l2lib so there is one call from text.c to
	  perform all the annotation
