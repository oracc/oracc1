SUPERGLOSSARY ALIGNMENT WORKFLOW
================================

* Alignment of a new glossary with a base glossary consists of three steps:

  - induction
  - comparison
  - mapping
  - merging

* Induction creates a simplified import of the glossary within the superproject's 00src directory

* Comparison checking the new glossary against the base glossary and reporting on differences

* Mapping is the means of resolving differences by treating entries in the new glossary as equivalent to existing entries in the base glossary

* Merging is the means of resolving differences by importing entries from the new glossary into the base glossary
