0. Marshalling
   -- use onebig.plx to create single XML file with all
      project data

1. Selection 
   -- configure by POS including multi-POS in one index
   -- optionally trim to remove unreferenced entries
   -- compounds or no compounds

2. Rewrite 
   -- determine index-heads (CF or ORTH)
   -- create xrefs if needed (ORTH mode needs xrefs 
      from non-head writings)
   -- induct index-specific names of texts from names.xml
   -- map labels to project-specific style

3. Sort
   -- only necessary if not using CF as head

4. Render
   -- current only to HTML
