Oracc Data Repo README File
===========================

This repository contains data created as part of Oracc, the Open
Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (http://oracc.org).

All of this data is made available under a Creative Commons CC-BY 3.0
license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/), meaning you
can share and adapt the data, but you must give appropriate credit.

We request that you give this credit in some manner which ensures that
all users of your derived work will be aware of the origins of the
original data, including the name of the Oracc project which created
it.

Oracc corpus-based projects typically include at least a catalogue and
some text editions, both of which are made available here.  Each type
of data is described separately below.

Catalogue Data
--------------

Catalogue data is made available both in XML and in tabbed format.

The catalogue fields are documented at http://oracc.org/doc2/XXX; a
current copy of this page is included in the repository as
doc/catalogue.html.

Corpus Data
-----------

The data is made available in several formats:

  OATF
  ****

	This is the format in which texts are typically entered.  The
	form of ATF in which data is provided in the repository is
	known by us as OATF, or Oracc ATF.

	OATF is documented at http://oracc.org/doc2/XXX; a current
	copy of this page is included in the repository as doc/OATF.html.

  XTF
  ***

	This is the XML format which Oracc uses internally.  XTF is
	documented at http://oracc.org/ns/xtf/1.0.  A current copy of
	this page is included in the repository as doc/XTF.html.

  TLEM
  ****

	This is a version of the linguistic annotation that the XTF
	files contain, arranged as tabbed files, with the data
	organized around word instances.  The TLEM format is
	documented at http://oracc.org/doc2/XXX, with a current copy
	in the repository at doc/TLEM.html.

  TATF
  ****

	This is a version of the OATF data which is structured as
	tabbed data.  It can be used in combination with TLEM as an
	easy interface to the linguistic annotation that XTF files
	contain. The TATF format is documented at
	http://oracc.org/doc2/XXX, with a current copy in the
	repository at doc/TATF.html.
