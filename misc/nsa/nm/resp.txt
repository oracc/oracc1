Yes, I had your previous request re: the fractions on my TODO list
already, and the incorrect alignment of the final u in 5(u) was the
font-design equivalent of a typo (a designo?).

I have it on my list to do normalization of fractions to lowest
common denominator; then at least the fact that there are multiple
ways of expressing the same fraction will be more obvious.

For actual occurrence information, we will (sometime next year) take
the NM database we're creating now and apply it to the corpus to make
a map of what actually occurs, so I'm going to punt for now the issue
of explicitly notating the existence of instances of multiple
expressions of the same value.

Yes, they are interesting, aren't they.  HIx(GAL.1) and HIx(GAL.2) with
readings szargaldisz and szargalmin.  But does HI really have a
reading szargal?  This stretches our notational conventions because I
would first think that it is |HI.GAL| = /szargal/; that would mean
the writing |HI&HI.GAL| would be /szargalmin/ if we put it together
with the Ea evidence.  So, I guess I end up thinking that you are
correct that the mental gymnastic is: multiply the HI-signs together
to get the number of szargals, and jot down the fact that they are
'gal' as supplementary information.  OK, I'll buy that.

yep; done

I guess to be consistent change gi etc. fraction sequence to "small to large".

> What does asterisk mean here? Is that a times sign?

Yes, but I see in your original doc you use space so I've fixed that.
There is an underlying issue here with the conversion process, i.e.,
for computation the AEV needs to be expressed as the relevant
multiples of a single step.  I need to do more work on steps AEV's
and MEV's, perhaps we should print the MEV for each step along with
the citation form.  The value expressed as a true AEV might not be
suitable for humans.

> 1/2 esz2 would be 1/2xESZ2 consistent with 1/2 USZ. 

Fixed the other way around, unless you'd prefer '*'--it's a 1-line
fix in the sequence of what I'm doing.

> We have no reading for USZ?

Well, there is usz, us, nitah/ninta/nita, jesz/jisz, or unu8.  Of
these, unu8 is 'a stick', so if I had to commit to something, that
would be it.  Unless they had very long penises.

You call it; play safe with USZ or take a shot with unu8?  The
evidence is just a couple of lexical passages, unless you can come up
with u-nu, u2-nu or the like in probative context--I just scanned the
TRANSLIT file for u-nu, u2-nu and u3-num and there was nothing relevant.
