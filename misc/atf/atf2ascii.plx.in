=head1 NAME

atf2ascii.plx -- convert Unicode characters to ATF ASCII

=head1 SYNOPSIS

atf2ascii.plx [file]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

atf2ascii.plx substitutes Unicode characters that may be part of
    transliteration for their ATF ASCII equivalents.  It is quite
    simple-minded about this and has no understanding of context.

Accented vowels are converted to numbers on the assumption that what
is being processed is a sequence of graphemes; this will mess up your
French so be careful if you are processing mixed input (this program
shouldn't be used to process mixed input...).
