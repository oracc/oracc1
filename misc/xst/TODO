#lem needs:

     insert or suppress sentence boundary after word

     #lem: sa[call] -.; dim[create] +.;

     insert clause-begin before word, with typing

     insert clause-end after word, with match to clause-begin

     probably OK to require that if one clause is given they all must be

e.g:

	#lem: (1:DE3 kalam[land]; szu[hand]; bala[turn] 1)
