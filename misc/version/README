INSTRUCTIONS FOR MIGRATING PROJECTS FROM CDL TO ORACC
=====================================================

1) run the new project creation script on oracc:

   su
   /usr/share/oracc/00/sys/newproj.sh PROJECT

   If you get warnings about the existence of the user or the
   group, you can safely run delproj, then newproj again. So,
   while still logged in as root:

   @@ORACC@@/00/sys/delproj.sh PROJECT
   @@ORACC@@/00/sys/newproj.sh PROJECT   

   When you run delproj, you may get warnings about no tarball
   being created, or the user not existing--these can be 
   ignored, as the script goes ahead and goes through all the
   steps for complete removal of a project regardless of
   whether some earlier step has failed.

2) login to the project on the *ORACC* server

3) run the migrate script, entering the password to the
   project on the *CDL* server when prompted

   migrate-user.sh PROJECT

4) rebuild the project:

   oracc rebuild
