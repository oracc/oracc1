ESP2+ TODO:
===========

HEADERS AND FOOTERS
- Do away with header
- Create new About This Site page instead (in main menu), which contains (links to):
  * brief copyrights & licensing
  * cookies and privacy
  * access keys
  * sitemap
  * standards
- Auto-generate footer, containing <license> <proj-name> <date> (where
  they are all set in parameters.xml) and brief cookies statement
  pointing to GA global optout
  (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)

  * on cookies, see also the Invormation Commissioner's Office's
    cookes guide
    http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Practical_application/cookies_guidance_v3.ashx

IMAGES
- change grid granularity from 5%ile to 1%ile
- external links can go in main menu now
- implement <esp:image position="right|left|inline"> and script out position="float"
  * update schema to match
- error message on rebuild if images too large
- error message on rebuild if page begins with <esp:image>


ESP2 Issues List:
=================

* fix navigation menu on page (only needs CSS, a la P3)

* divide glossary into header and entries so bookmarks are static at top of 
  page while browsing (same CSS-div techniques as P3)

* images must be sized physically to desired X-Y; img height=/width= doesn't work with gridding

* doc2 into public oracc repo

RESOLVED OR DROPPED:
====================

* images go in 00static

* imagemaps should be dropped

* imageinline means image-not-floating rather than 'inline' in the text processing sense

* ncr builds a portal and makes it live; for testing, use oracc esp then ncr to do the proper 
  full rebuild which also handles the full text indexing

* ongoing management of doc2/esp2

* tags dropped
