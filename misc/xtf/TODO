implement @edge a

check status/primes implementation on @-lines

change m type=text to type=discourse

check subtype implementation of discourse milestones

implement %n {d}s^in(|EN.ZU|) functioning as qualified normalized word
(i.e., logogram; allow any l.inner within qualification but not
multiple words).

clean up $ seal 1 implementation (diagnostics/information stashing)

labels documentation; reference under @label in XTF2 manual and in link docs

Document:

	Math (and implement!)

@label doesn't use @n element of line, but @o

'top of reverse' doesn't mean what users think

implement 

@m=text 1 = Ura 1
.
.
.
@m=text 2 = Ura 2

so that P123456.t1 and P123456.t2 are separate master-corpus entries

=====

document the way fragment works: it is a milestone which must be used repeatedly
within surface/column--you can't have @reverse of two fragments
because conceptually you have two parts of the reverse of the object
evidenced by different frags.  So, you must do:

 @reverse
 @fragment A
 1. 
 @fragment b
 1.

Not

 @fragment A
 @reverse

etc.
