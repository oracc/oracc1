Oracc Discourse Model
=====================

The Oracc Discourse Model is the way Oracc views the combination of
elements that make up an ancient text, be it the collection of
inscribed material on a particular object or the virtual
reconstruction which we normally call a 'composite'.  

The model divides discourse into two broad categories: units and
features. Units are a block category and are containers of parts of a
text, while features are collections of language-elements which may be
discontinuous.


Discourse Units
---------------

Top Level
*********

At the top level is the TEXT unit, which may be repeated (for example
on exercise texts and collective tablets).

The ATF tag for TEXT is @text.

Second Level
************

At the next level are BODY and META units:

	BODY: the text content proper--often a transaction or a narrative

	META: anything other than the text

BODY may be discontinuous, that is, it may be interspersed with META
blocks.  In this case, the BODY text as seen by linguistic processors
is the concatenated content of all the BODY units without the
intervention of the META units.

In the case of multilingual texts, a BODY unit is generated for each
language.  Partial treatments of the BODY in a language should be
marked (DEFINE HOW).

METAS
-----

The syntax of a META tag in ATF is:

 @meta RELN NAME

METAs are considered to exist in some specified relationship (RELN) to
the BODY. These relationships are:

	FUNC: the META is functionally related to the BODY
	DATA: the META provides metadata about the
	      the text or production process
	NONE: the META is independent

The NAMEs of several common METAs are available as shorthands:

	@witnesses  = @meta func witnesses

	@sealings =   @meta func sealings (should really use
		      	    signatures instead)

	@signatures = @meta func signatures

	@colophon   = @meta data colophon

Others may be given after the META tag following the relator
designation.

Third Level
***********

At the third level the content of BODY and META differs.

BODY always contains zero or more SENTENCEs.

META contains a mixture of MET3s and UNITs:

     MET3 : third level META, used for discourse features
     UNIT : a neutral label for a segment of the text 
     	    analogous to a SENTENCE.

MET3s may also be typed and may have their own RELN, inheriting from
their immediate parent if they have no RELN.

At the ATF level, much of this structure is elided in favour
of convenience tags for discourse features: a feature tag will
automatically be wrapped in the necessary UNIT and META 
containers by the ATF processor.

The following convenience tags are defined for discourse
features:

	@signature : @met3 func signature

	@sealing :   @met3 func signature

	@date :      @met3 data date

	@incipit :   @met3 data incipit : opening words of a composition

	@catchline : @met3 data catchline : line of next text/tablet

	@rubric : performance division, sajara, kirugu, etc.

	@subscript : designation of text-type

	@doxology : address/dedication to deity

	@scribe :
