Scores in Oracc

Oracc supports both matrices and longhand scores, which we 
call synoptica.  In the case of matrices, a score may be
parsed or unparsed.  In the initial implementation, all
matrices are unparsed, but they are displayed using a fixed
pitch font, so if they align in the data source they should
also align onscreen.

The command for a score is @score.  It takes up to two 
arguments:

 @score matrix parsed
 @score matrix unparsed
 @score synopticon parsed
 @score synopticon unparsed

The lines in a synopticon may be given inline or as references.
In the latter case, the reference must be a link using << to
pull the text from the source.

Parsed means two different things for matrices and synoptica.

For a matrix, it means that the tabular content is parsed into
a matrix.  The conventions for this are not yet defined.

For a synopticon, it means that the label is parsed and validated to
ensure that it meets ATF rules.  This allows the exemplar text of a
synopticon to be rewritten as a transliteration of the witness.

The structure of a score is:

X. xxx
Y: yyy

Where X is a line number per usual ATF conventions, and Y is a
siglum; xxx and yyy are the text of the composite and exemplar
respectively.

The content of the composite may be omitted.

The structure of a siglum is:

 S'|'L

Where S is the siglum proper and L is a label giving the location
of the text on the original object. '|' is the vertical bar 
character, used as a delimiter between S and L.

The components of a label may not contain spaces; the underscore
character must be used instead.
