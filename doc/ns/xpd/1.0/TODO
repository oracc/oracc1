OK, that's looking good now. The only remaining problems are that: 1)
the explanations to the core elements aren't showing up online, just
the one-line descriptors. The longer explanations are visible for all
the option elements though. And 2) the core elements we decided would
be non-editable with the webservice aren't showing either, but I guess
we still need them while config files are hand-edited.
