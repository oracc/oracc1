        <pre class="help">The automatically generated file 00lib/approved.lst gives 
all the texts which are considered part of the project. 
You can choose how that list is made: 

(a) "atf" harvests p-numbers and q-numbers from the ATF 
files in 00atf/ ; 

(b) "catalog" takes all the p- and q-numbers from the 
project's catalogue (if it has one); 

(c) "mixed" finds all the p- and q-numbers that are in 
the ATF files and/or the catalogue (but you will have to make
deletions manually);

(d) "static" makes no changes to 00lib/approved.lst 
(which you will have to edit by hand if you want to change it);

(e) "umbrella" generates 00lib/approved.lst from all the
approved.lst's in the project's subprojects.</pre>

(a) "approved" displays all the texts in approved.lst;

ATF files;

the composite texts); and

00lib/outlined.lst with the option pager-outlined-lst on the Pager

        <pre class="help"> Catalog options control the source of your project's metadata.

 The default is "auto", which takes data from the CDLI main 
catalogue as installed on Oracc. This is the recommended approach, 
since it encourages corrections to be propagated directly back to 
the CDLI catalogue.

If you use your own version of the CDLI catalogue with the same 
fields, then set the value to "local". 

If your corpus is composed entirely of texts from (an)other project(s),
e.g., by proxying or as an umbrella, set the value to "virtual". The
catalogue data will then be drawn from those other projects.

If, unusually, your project has a customised catalogue, set the 
value to "custom".

If you use a custom xml catalogue the catalogue configuration is 
more complicated and is not documented here. (Briefly, it is handled
by a file called 00lib/keydata.xml.) If you do need a custom 
catalogue, please consult your project liaison about configuration 
options.</pre>
