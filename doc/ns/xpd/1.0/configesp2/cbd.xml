        <pre class="help">This option allows you to set how your project's 
glossaries are built. There are four possibilities:

(a) "mixed": existing glossary files (e.g., 00lib/akk.glo) 
are merged with new glossary data (e.g., from 00lib/akk.new)
when you run the harvest-merge sequence prior to rebuilding 
a project.

(b) "dynamic": your project's glossaries are created anew 
from your lemmatised ATF files every time you rebuild your 
project.

(c) "static": the only way to change your project's 
glossaries is to edit them by hand.

(d) "none": your project has no glossaries.</pre>
