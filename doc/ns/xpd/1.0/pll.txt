Projects, Lists & Links (PLL)
=============================

Oracc gathers several different types of corpus and
link navigation under a single drop-down menu at the
top of the pager.  This drop-down is known as the
PLL menu.

Some of the PLL entries are created for you, others
must be entered in 00lib/pll.xml, which has the
following basic structure:

 <pll>
   <list menu="MENU-NAME" file="FILE-NAME"/>
   <link menu="MENU-NAME" url="URL"/>
 </pll>

Projects
***********

Public ancestor and subprojects are automatically added to PLL.

Lists
*****

Lists of PQX numbers can be placed in the 00lib/lists
directory from where they are copied to the web 
directory and can be accessed by the URL:

 http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/PROJECT/LIST

In addition, if a list entry is given pll.xml, that
entry is added to the menu.

For example, if a project has texts belonging to 
several libraries, one could create lists for each
library and add entries like this to pll.xml:

 <list menu="Resh Temple Library" file="resh"/>

Which would correspond to a list file 00lib/lists/resh.


Links
*****

Links to websites which are not in the project hierarchy 
can also be included in pll.xml.  These have two forms,
a short form for commonly used links and a long form for
links that are not in Oracc's list of known links.

All of these links open in a new window.

Short Form
----------

The short form simply gives an identifier for the link, 
e.g.:

 <link id="CDLI"/>

Oracc expands this to the long form for you, and puts
the relevant entry in the PLL menu.

The long form requires you to specify the text to appear
in the menu and the URL to which it points, e.g.:

 <link menu="CDLI"
       url="http://cdli.ucla.edu"/>

When choosing the name for the menu, use the full name
of the project for projects which may not be well known
to users, unless that name is more than about 20
characters--there is a reasonable amount of space for
the PLL drop-down, but we don't want the top buttons
to be completely dominated by it.  Long project names
can either use a standard abbreviation for the project
or the first three words followed by an ellipsis. Thus,
an alternative form of the CDLI menu item might have
been:

  menu="Cuneiform Digital Lib..."

When deciding how to abbreviate such names, it is 
reasonable to base the final choice on the look of
your project when viewed in the P2 pager--the 20
character limit should be viewed as a guideline rather
than a rule.

The list of links which can be referenced by ID is kept
at:

http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/builder/p2/linkids.html

To suggest additional commonly-used links e-mail 
osc@oracc.org.

(The data list of IDs is src/misc/p2/pll_linkids.xml installed as
lib/data/pll_linkids.xml)

Example
-------

(Interim example which is currently used for testing in p3-saao.xml)

<pll>
  <list menu="Arpad" file="arpad"/>
  <link menu="Knowledge &amp; Power" url="http://knp.prs.heacademy.ac.uk"/>
  <link id="AEB"/>
</pll>
